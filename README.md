# Through The Clouds: Introduction to Cloud Computing


We will learn how to create a simple chat application in four sub-projects: `pingpong1`, `pingpong2`, `clientregistry` and `instantmessage`. Below you will find relevant code files to download, along with READMEs to help you on your path.

## Setting Up

To setup, you will need to have Python3 installed, along with the Tkinter python package. Instructions to do the same can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EYahBVYY3M8gNL7gEndLgW-JRANZcqRo5gKVnC7Y3Zk/edit?usp=sharing). The document also contains instructions to download and install a simple editor, [Atom](https://atom.io/).
